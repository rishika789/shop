                In the past decade, there has been a dramatic shift in how India shops. For a country steeped in a rich history of ‘bazaar shopping’, the benefits of e-commerce have slowly drawn Indian consumers away from brick and mortar stores towards the sheer convenience and choices that come with online shopping.
                This switch certainly did not happen overnight. Metro users were the first to adopt e-commerce, thanks to good connectivity, sound knowledge of the internet, and relatively high disposable incomes. However, over the last few years, we have started seeing a new set of users emerge following a surge in network connectivity and lower data costs across the country, ensuring easy access to the internet by residents of Tier II cities and beyond, which we call ‘Bharat’.
                These next set of customers are very different from the existing users. They have their own aspirations and challenges. One of their biggest challenges is the comprehension of language. As our interface was built in English, it was a challenge for them to use website. To help these users we launched website in Hindi last year and were overwhelmed by the response. We have now expanded our interface in three new Indic languages — Tamil, Telugu, and Kannada.

                I grew up in Marathahalli, Bengaluru, and studied Mechanical Engineering in college. But honestly, my heart wasn’t in pursuing technical fields and I was more interested in sales and marketing. I joined the website customer service team in August 2019 as I knew I’d like talking to customers. But, this was my first job and I was very nervous when I took my first call. Back then, I wasn’t even able to talk properly! However, after learning from my trainers and getting certification, things went really well. I now take escalation calls that go up to an hour or more.
While guidelines are there for us to follow, sometimes it’s about more than processes. At times, we have to push it. We have to contact other people, we have to take steps. It’s not about filling out a form or sending an email, but pushing various teams to reply soon. What can take 48 hours, I try to resolve in 24 hours, and giving customers resolutions quicker than the stated timeline is what results in appreciation.
What works for me is to first listen to customers. Let them talk. Every case is different and sometimes a query is critical and we have to do everything simultaneously. I answer each call thinking I have to give a resolution and create a bond. This way, most customers call me by my name by the end of the call.”

                We started the year in good spirits, spreading cheer and positivity. In our constant efforts to make the world a colourful and happier place for all, we at Myntra, are delighted to partner with famous Tollywood Actor, Producer Lakshmi Manchu’s Teach For Change, where she is a Trustee and Chairperson for a one-of-a-kind initiative to help less privileged kids.  Teach for Change is a program that aims to improve literacy and life skills among children studying in government schools across Hyderabad.

Delivering boxes of happiness!

Spreading cheer and positivity in their lives, we at Myntra facilitated the distribution of clothes and footwear among 1000 children associated with the Teach for Change program. It was encouraging and heartwarming to see the smiles on the children’s faces as they received their special boxes of curated goodies.
